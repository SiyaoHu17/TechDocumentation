For most "average" problems, you should have 10,000 - 100,000 examples. 
For “hard” problems like machine translation, high dimensional data generation, or anything requiring deep learning, you should try to get 100,000 - 1,000,000 examples. 
Generally, the more dimensions your data has, the more data you need.
